/**
 * What the two contributions beside `seo`'s settings ask the backend, and the
 * one place they ask it from.
 *
 * The preview beside *Custom robots.txt instructions* and the notice on the
 * *Default robots* row both need the same answer for the same sales channel,
 * and each answer costs a request from the backend to a storefront. So the
 * answer is held here for both to read: two rows on one screen are one
 * request, not two.
 *
 * **When the backend is asked** — when what a row previews changes (the
 * channel, or the page going between "all channels" and one channel), when a
 * row asks again, and when either row stops being dirty, which is a save or a
 * reset. **Typing never asks**: the operator's part of the preview comes from
 * the field, in the browser, and is sent nowhere.
 *
 * **What is kept** — the answer for a channel, in this tab's memory, for as
 * long as a row on the screen is showing that channel in that editing mode and
 * no longer. A request that starts drops the answer it replaces, and what
 * nobody is showing is forgotten — so rules, and the fact that a channel has a
 * value of its own, are never shown as current while a newer answer is on its
 * way, after it failed to arrive, or on a later visit (FR-042).
